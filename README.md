# Sign-Language-Recognition-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning-with-VGG16-ResNet-and-Inception
Explore sign language recognition through deep learning. This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16, ResNet, and Inception models to recognize American Sign Language gestures. Dive into image classification, data augmentation, and evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices and precision-recall.
