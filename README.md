# Sign Language Recognition with Deep Learning

![Sign Language Recognition](project_image.png)

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a Sign Language Recognition project using deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to build and train a deep learning model capable of recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. The project incorporates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and transfer learning with pre-trained models.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Preparation**: Data loading, exploration, preprocessing, and augmentation.
2. **Model Building**: Construction of deep learning models, including custom CNN architecture and transfer learning with popular models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3.
3. **Training**: Training the models with data and monitoring training progress.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluation of model performance, including accuracy, confusion matrix, recall, and precision.
5. **Data Augmentation**: Techniques to augment training data for improved generalization.
6. **Learning Rate Schedulers**: Implementation of learning rate schedulers for better convergence.
7. **Early Stopping**: Integration of early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.
8. **Batch Normalization**: Addition of batch normalization layers for training stability.
9. **Different CNN Architectures**: Experimentation with various CNN architectures.
10. **Dropout Rate Tuning**: Fine-tuning dropout rates for effective learning.
11. **Regularization**: Incorporation of L1 or L2 regularization to reduce overfitting.
12. **Data Balancing**: Addressing class imbalances using oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting.
